# Bird-Species-Classification

In this I have used Transfer learning and captum

1. Dataset consists of Images meaning unstructured data.
2. The size of dataset is 2GB 
3. As the dataset is huge and unstructured it is a Big Data Problem.
4. Images are classified into bird species, so image count in each bird with respect to nmaes in dictionary
5. We use Transfer learning, for predictions, which is a lighter version of genetic algorithm which uses previous knowledge of a training set for next item prediction.
6. Our contribution is that we have used captum which identifies heat signatures in images to highlight important object in images which are birds.
